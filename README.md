Web app that uses JeremiasRy/SudokuApi to solve or make a random sudoku for user.

To run locally you'll need to first put JeremiasRy/SudokuApi running locally. <br/>
When you have the backend running just git clone, npm install and npm start! <br/>
There is also some basic css animations to make it more entertaining and cheesy.

Hmmm... that's a hard looking sudoku...
